# 90-DAYS-JAVASCRIPT-CHALLENGE

Hello Everyone! My name is Abhijeet and I am a full time student and learning and doing web development and web3 development. I took this 90 days javascript challenge to be consistent, enhance my skills and learn and grow together with others by building in public.

## DAY 1

This is DAY 1 of 90 days javascript challenge. 
### Topic learnt today: Basics of Javascript

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages .

JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995. Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as a scripting language for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator. Initially known as LiveScript, Netscape changed the name to JavaScript so they could position it as a companion for the Java language, a product of their partner, Sun Microsystems.

JavaScript has come a long way since its original implementation: it took a mere 10 days to write it. The JavaScript standard, proposed for the first time as ECMAScript 1 in 1997, is, as of late 2018, in its 9th iteration (ES 2018). The differences between the specifications described in ECMAScript 1 and ES 2018 are immense: they seem to describe different languages. In the intervening years, JavaScript has undergone massive changes. Not everyone agreed with every change, but, taken together, they made JavaScript a more robust, secure, and expressive language.
